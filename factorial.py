"""This code defines a Python function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number `n`. Here's how it works:

1. `def factorial(n):`: This line defines a function named `factorial` that takes one argument `n`, representing the number for which the factorial needs to be calculated.

2. `result = 1`: This initializes a variable `result` to store the factorial value. We start with `1` because the factorial of `0` and `1` is `1`.

3. `for i in range(1, n + 1):`: This sets up a for loop that iterates over the numbers from `1` to `n`, inclusive. 
    It ensures that all numbers from `1` up to and including `n` are multiplied together.

4. `result *= i`: Within the loop, each iteration multiplies the current value of `result` by the current value of `i`. 
    This effectively calculates the factorial as it iterates through the numbers.

5. After the loop completes, the function returns the final value of `result`, which represents the factorial of `n`.

6. The example usage `print(factorial(5))` demonstrates how to call the `factorial` function with the argument `5` and prints the factorial value, which is `120`.

So, in summary, the function calculates the factorial of a given number `n` by multiplying all the numbers from `1` to `n` together and returns the result."""
